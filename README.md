# Open CV Feature Detection and Tracking

This is a series of scripts I wrote for my Computational Geometry (CS 6301.008) class in Spring 2018 at The University of Texas at Dallas. 

It uses various OpenCV algorithms to detect and track features. 

## Dependencies
Python 3, OpenCV 3 and NumPy. 

## Running
You need to pass an image or video (depending on the script). The location can be modified based on script. Once setup, use `python3 .` to run. It will ask you for choice of script to run and show the output as it runs.
